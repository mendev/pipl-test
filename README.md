# pipl-test
Instructions:
1. run the init-server script from your linux workstation to enable work on the remote host
2. run the ansible playbook main.yml that encapsulates all other playbooks.



Remarks:
1. The cerebro and kibana hosts are running under "/kibana" and "/cerebro" paths on the nginx
2. the nginx credentials are admin:Aa123456 (simple I know)
3. I was not able to run the DB instances on my home PC due to limited resources. The ELK stack as it is almost crushed it.
